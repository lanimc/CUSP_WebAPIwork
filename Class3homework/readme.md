Q1

<h1>Looping a triangle</h1>


Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######

Q2 

<h1>FizzBuzz</h1>

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).


Q3 

<h1>Chess Board</h1>

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

I found constructing functions not too difficult, although constructing the last one was a challenge.  I tried to use the case syntax for the if/else if statements but couldn't get them to work. I also played around with trying to add the results to the html file itself ratherthan just to the console.
